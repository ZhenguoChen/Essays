As you can see in this page, Trello allows you to create your own *board* for you project.
So, what exactly is a Trello board? As explained by Trello itself:

> A Trello board is a series of lists, with a bunch of cards attached.

A basic Trello setup consists of the following three components:

1. Boards. 
2. Lists. By default, there are three types of lists in a board, "To Do", "Doing", and "Done".
3. Cards. A card can represent a task you need to do, or a task you are doing now, or a task
you have done, depending on which list it is attached to.

You can add a list by simply clicking on the `Add a list...`. The most impressive thing about
Trello is its cards. Trello allows you to create cards with detailed description, such as
adding attachments, creating checklists and adding comments.

You can edit cards any time you want to update information about your tasks. You can
also add labels to your cards. There is also a `color blind friendly mode` option for those
who have color blind problem.
