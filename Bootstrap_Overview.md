# Bootstrap: Overview

**Zhenguo Chen**

## Introduction

What it says in [Bootstrap website](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/) is not a brag:

>Bootstrap is the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites and applications. Inside you’ll find high quality HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make starting any project easier than ever.

Bootstrap is an open source toolkit developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter for building responsive
web. It has lots of prebuilt components and powerful plugins built on jQuery. Before Bootstrap, there were many
libraries used for developing web interface, which brings a hugh amount of burden for websites maintenance. One 
remarkable feature of Bootstrap is its support for [responsive web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design).
That means the layouts of your web apps can adjust dynamically and looks good on **ANY** platform (desktop, tablet,
mobile phone).

## Bootstrap Grid System

Bootstrap builds the layouts using a [grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/). This grid 
system allows up to 12 columns across the page. You can group the columns together to create a wider column.
