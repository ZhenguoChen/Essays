## Introduction

Drew Houston, the CEO and founder of [Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox_(service)), is considered 
one of the most successful graduates of [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator_(company)).
His company, Dropbox which is founded in 2007, filed its S-1 in Feb 23rd and became the first startup to ever file 
for an IPO. His product, Dropbox, is popular all over the world, providing services to more than 200,000 businesses 
and 500 million people. It took him 10 years to build Dropbox from one single line of code to one of the fastest-growing 
companies in the world.

## Idea

The initial idea of Dropbox came from the inconvenience of thumb drives since he always left it at home when he
actually needed it. So, he started thinking about creating a file sharing system to solve this problem. In his
[interview with Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/dropbox-founder-and-ceo-drew-houston-interview-2017-6),
he said:

>The proverbial story is: I was going from Boston to New York on the Chinatown bus, forgot my thumb drive, and I was so frustrated â€” really with myself, because this kept happening. And I'm like, my God, I never want to have this problem again. And I opened up the editor and started writing some code. I had no idea what it would become. But those were the beginnings.

## Growth of Dropbox

After making some progress, he started applying for Y Combinator. However, he was informed that he would need a
cofounder to get into the accelerator. Fortunately, a MIT student, [Arash Ferdowsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arash_Ferdowsi)
reached out and had a short conversation with Houston. After a two-hours-conversation, Ferdowski decided to drop
out of MIT and work with Houston. As described by Houston:

>"It was sort of like getting married on the first or second date. It was wild because I thought I would have to, like, talk to his parents or somehow reassure him that this was a good decision to spend most of our waking hours for the foreseeable future together, but to his credit, he just jumped right in."

It took a long time for Dropbox to launch its service. However, it attracted much attraction after it launched its 
service, even Apple showed its interest in this promising company. Jobs requested a meeting with Houston and tried
to convince Houston to sell his company since he felt that Dropbox is a feature rather than a product, and
they will be at a disadvantage if put up onto the market. However, under the pressure of Jobs, Houston still turned down the offer and faced the challenge of iCloud.

As it turned out, Dropbox experienced a stunning growth. It has seen steady user growth since its inception. In 2010, 
its user number grew from 1 million in April, to 2 million in September, and 3 million in November. And now, it has
 more than 500 million users. Its revenue hit $240 million in 2011 even though 96% of ts user pay nothing. With more 
and more users upgrading their storage, Dropbox's revenue is ever increasing and becoming a billion-dollar enterprise.
