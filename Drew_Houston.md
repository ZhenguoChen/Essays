## Intorduction

Drew Houston, the CEO and founder of [Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox_(service)), is considered 
one of the most successful graduates of [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator_(company)).
His company, Dropbox, filed its S-1 in Feb 23rd, became the first startup to ever file for an IPO. His product, 
Dropbox, is popular all over the world, providing services to more than 200,000 businesses and 500 million people.
It took him 10 years to build Dropbox from one single line of code to one of the fastest-growing companies in the
world.

## Idea

The initial idea of Dropbox came from the inconvenience of thumb drives since he always left it at home when he
actually need it. So, he started thinking about creating a file sharing system to solve this problem. In his
[interview with Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/dropbox-founder-and-ceo-drew-houston-interview-2017-6)
he said:

>>The proverbial story is: I was going from Boston to New York on the Chinatown bus, forgot my thumb drive, and I was so frustrated â€” really with myself, because this kept happening. And I'm like, my God, I never want to have this problem again. And I opened up the editor and started writing some code. I had no idea what it would become. But those were the beginnings.

## Growth of Dropbox

After making some progress, he started applying for Y Combinator. However, he was informed that he would need a
cofounder to get into the accelerator. Fortunately, a MIT student, [Arash Ferdowsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arash_Ferdowsi)
reached out and had a short conversation with Houston. After a two-hours-conversation, Ferdowski decided to drop
out of MIT and work with Houston.

It took a long time for Dropbox to launch its service. However, it got lots of attraction after it launched its 
service, even Apple show its interest in this promising company. Jobs requested a meeting with Houston and tried
to convince Houston to sell his company. He even pointed out that Dropbox is a feature rather than a product, and
they will be disadvantaged. However, under the pressure of Jobs, Houston still turned off the offer and faced the
challenge of iCloud.

As it turns out, Dropbox experienced a stunning growth. Its revenue hit $240 million in 2011 even though 96% of
its user pay nothing. With more and more users upgrading their storage, Dropbox has its revenue keeps increasing
and become a billion-dollar enterprise.
